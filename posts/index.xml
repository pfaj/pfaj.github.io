            <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a server recently and I thought that I would share. The hardware of
the server is an old Dell Optiplex that I was gifted, the specs are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;CPU: Intel i7-7700
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Memory: 16GB DDR4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Storage: 256GB NVME &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;OS&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp; 512GB SATA &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Data&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;OS: NixOS &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;the best OS&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;My OS of choice was NixOS due to its modularity and ease of use when spinning
up services and I already use it for my personal devices so it just made sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I made a server recently and I thought that I would share. The hardware of
the server is an old Dell Optiplex that I was gifted, the specs are:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>CPU: Intel i7-7700

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>OS: NixOS <span style="color:#f92672">(</span>the best OS<span style="color:#f92672">)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>My OS of choice was NixOS due to its modularity and ease of use when spinning
up services and I already use it for my personal devices so it just made sense.</p>
<p>I do have a repo that contains the config for the server and all the modules
that I have configured linked <a href="https://github.com/pfaj/nix-server-config">here</a>
and if you are interested in some general use configs I have another repo
<a href="https://github.com/pfaj/nixos-config">here</a>.</p>
<p>My server is still in an infant state as I learn more about hosting, DNS, and
just the overall concepts of running a server. I will say it has been rewarding to
spin up some of these services and use them in my day to day.</p>
<h2 id="services">Services</h2>
<p>Currently I only use a couple services on a daily basis. Those are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://caddyserver.com/">ACME</a> (Certificate Management)</li>
<li><a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> (Reverse Proxy)</li>
<li><a href="https://cryptpad.org/">Cryptpad</a> (Office Suite)</li>
<li><a href="https://minecraft.net">Minecraft</a> (Required for server to run)</li>
<li><a href="https://immich.app/">Immich</a> (Images)</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.searxng.org/">SearXNG</a> (Search Engine)</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most impactful for my day to day has been SearXNG, it has allowed me
to search without having the AI generated response that blocks the sites that
I am looking for and overall removes a lot of bloat that other search engines
have.</p>
<p>I started using these services through Tailscale so that I can focus on
just getting the services running before I point them to a subdomain and open
them up to the internet. For a while my process on my devices would be to
connect to the VPN to then access the service or server which became tedious.
So once I was able to get these services running for a couple months with no
interruptions I decided to point to subdomains using Caddy and ACME so that I
do not have to rely on Tailscale so much especially from my phone. I know that
there are some security risks involved but it has been a good learning
experience to understand how DNS and Reverse Proxies work. Additionally, I use
key-based SSH to do maintenance on the server whether it be updates or trying
to resolve an issue with one of these services.</p>
<h2 id="why-nixos">Why NixOS</h2>
<p>I chose NixOS for the reason previously mentioned for one. I already had a
working config that I could modify for this case, but there&rsquo;s more to it. To me
the idea of being reproducible is great, the amount of times that I have broken
a Linux system because of the wrong command or a new update has taught me that
it&rsquo;s great to have an easy way to restore your systems last working state.
NixOS has proved to be great for that allowing me to jump back to previous
generations and the ability to pickup the config and move it to another device
with little to no issues and have it set up exactly the same as the other device
if needed.</p>
<h2 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h2>
<p>In the future I would like to target some of the hardware such as my storage
and setup RAID as currently I do not have redundancy. It does leave a slight
worry of data loss, but if that&rsquo;s what happens I will figure it out then. With
the current rise in hardware prices it does not make sense to try and pickup
those parts for an absurd price (thanks AI).</p>
<h2 id="final-notes">Final Notes</h2>
<p>This project has been really fun to work on and has taught me about managing a
server and also using NixOS. If you want to try one of my services you can go
to <a href="https://search.ajimenez.me/">https://search.ajimenez.me/</a> which will take you to SearXNG.</p>
